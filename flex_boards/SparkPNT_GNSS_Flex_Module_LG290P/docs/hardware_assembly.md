## GNSS Antenna
In order to receive [GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Global Navigation Satellite System") signals, users will need to connect a compatible antenna. For the best performance, we recommend users choose an active, L1/L2/L5/L6 GNSS antenna and utilize a low-loss cable.



### U.FL Connector
GNSS antennas are connected to the U.FL connector on the GNSS Flex board. For sturdier connections, users have the option to bridging the connection to the SMA connector on a Flex carrier board.

## GNSS Flex Headers
SparkPNT GNSS Flex modules are *plug-in boards* featuring different GNSS receivers. They are designed to be easily swapped for repairs and pin-compatible for upgrades. The boards come populated with two 2x10 pin, 2mm pitch female headers for connecting to *carrier boards*.
